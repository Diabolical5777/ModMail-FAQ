      Providing the administrator role to Modmail would migitate any issues when it comes to permissions, however we do not encourage anyone to provide the administrator permission to ANY bots in your server (unless you have FULL control over the code and how the bot functions). Modmail does not require administrator, however it does require certain permissions to work. Check the "What permissions does ModMail need?" option for more information.

      First off, make sure whether or not you have anonymous replies enabled. Run `=viewconfig`, and then check whether it says `Enabled` or `Disabled` under "Anonymous Messaging". If it's disabled, enable it via the `=anonymous` command. If anonymous messaging is enabled, then make sure you're not using the commands (or have command only mode). Anonymous messages will only apply to messages sent without commands. If you want to send an anonymous message via commands, use `=areply`.

      Please check the following before asking for help:
      • The bot has Read Messages, Send Messages, and Embed Links permissions.
      • You are using the correct prefix. Use @ModMail prefix to check the prefix.
      • The command you are using is valid. Check using =help <command>.
      • The bot is online. Discord might be having issues, or the bot might be restarting.

      Depending on the tier of premium purchased users will get access to premium features on 1 server (<@&576756461267451934>), 3 servers (<@&576754574346551306>) and 5 servers (<@&576754671620980740>).
      Users can manage their premium with the following commands:
      - `=premiumassign <server id>`
      - `=premiumremove <server id>`
      - `=premiumslist`
      
      Users will also get access to the ticket snippet functionality. This allows staff to easily and quickly reply to users with a pre-defined response. The commands to manage snippets are:
      - `=viewsnippet [optional snippet name]`
      - `=snippetadd <snippet name> <snippet content>`
      - `=snippetremove <snippet name>`

      To use a snippet in a ticket staff can use the following commands:

      This enables them to use the premium management commands to assign/remove premium from servers as well as check which servers they have premium on.
      These commands are found on page 7 of the `=help` command, the second to last page

      **Users must have joined this server before purchasing otherwise they will not have received the patron role and will not be able to use the premium management commands**

      *Note: We can manually assign patron roles to those who do not join before purchase however the user will need to provide proof of payment via a ModMail ticket and the process could take a few hours while we wait for an administrator to be available.*

      To change the prefix for your server use the `=prefix <new prefix>` command. This will change the prefix for your server e.g. `=prefix !`.
      To view the current prefix for your server use the `=prefix` command without any arguments.

      via the =logging command, you can recreate, change and disable the logging channel. If your logging channel was deleted, run =logging to disable it and then re-enable it, which should re-create the channel. If you want to use an existing channel, disable logging by running =logging once. Then run =logging #channel_name to re-enable logging and to send logs to an already existing channel of your choice.
